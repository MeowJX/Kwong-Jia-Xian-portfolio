    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am a hard-working student and a self-taught aspiring badminton player. I started playing badminton in mid-2023 and have been in love with this sport after learning the basic grips of badminton shots from a neighboring uncle. The first time I experienced fear in badminton was in the 2024 Shuttles Challenge, a competition hosted by Singapore Management University. Now, after a year of badminton experience, I have fallen deeper in love with this sport.</p>
